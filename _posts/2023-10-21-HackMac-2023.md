One of my favourite times of year at Macquarie University is [HackMac](https://hackmac.xyz/)! This is an annual Capture the Flag competition that Macquarie University hosts which opened this year to students around NSW including highschool, TAFE, and other universities. This year it was hosted at the Institute of Applied Technology Digital (IATD) at Meadowbank TAFE.

Challenges are made by the awesome MQU IT team as well as students that are are part of Macquarie Universities Professional and Community Engagement unit (PACE). There were a range of challenges from beginner to advanced levels with different categories like OSINT (my personal favourite), reverse engineering, cryptography and more. Not only that but there was also physical hacking too in the form of lockpicks, another favourite of mine. 

My main mission of the day was to get as many challenges as possible as well as learn something new (or multiple things, no pressure). And I achieved this! Last HackMac I was only able to solve a couple challenges as I did not have very much knowledge on these competitions and therefore no clue where to start. This year, I had a little bit more knowledge.

## Challenges
Since I am writing this almost a year later (don't judge me, I'm tired), I do not remember how many challenges I was actually able to do as I also hadn't learnt that documentation of my own challenge solving is genuinely helpful. So please enjoy these small snippets of different challenges!

### Encrypt that Chef
This was a nice starting challenge, I love using CyberChef especially for their Magic feature. It meant that I was able to put in a couple inputs from what I noticed from the inputs that were given and magic the rest.

### Azure 0
This was my first time trying hacking Azure, I didn't get too far and I believe this challenge actually had a set of 5 or 6 challenges. However I was able to get through the first one (mainly because it was simple lookups)!
