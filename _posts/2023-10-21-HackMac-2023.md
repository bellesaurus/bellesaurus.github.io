One of my favourite times of year at Macquarie University is HackMac! This is an annual Capture the Flag competition that Macquarie University hosts which opened this year to students around NSW including highschool, TAFE, and other universities. This year it was hosted at the Institute of Applied Technology Digital (IATD) at Meadowbank TAFE.

Challenges are made by the awesome MQU IT team as well as students that are are part of Macquarie Universities Professional and Community Engagement unit (PACE). There were a range of challenges from beginner to advanced levels with different categories like OSINT (my personal favourite), reverse engineering, cryptography and more.
